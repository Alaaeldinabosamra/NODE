It sounds like you have a well-structured full-stack project with Node.js, Mongoose, and Pug templates. In this type of architecture, the goal is to cleanly separate concerns, such as routing, data handling, and UI presentation, making it easier to maintain and scale the application.

Here is an outline of the folder structure you're likely using, along with a brief explanation of the purpose of each folder and file:
